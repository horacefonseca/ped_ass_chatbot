     → Books appointment with Dr. Garcia
     → Confirms with appointment ID #1234
```

### **Scenario 2: Emergency Detection**
```
👤 User: "I'm having a heart attack!"
🤖 Bot: 🚨 EMERGENCY DETECTED
     → Immediately redirects to 911
     → Provides emergency guidance
     → Offers to schedule follow-up after emergency care
```

### **Scenario 3: Information Requests**
```
👤 User: "What are your hours?"
🤖 Bot: Provides complete clinic information:
     → Hours, location, contact details
     → Parking and transportation info
     → Insurance acceptance details
```

## 💾 Database Design

### **Appointment Management System**
```sql
-- Appointments Table
CREATE TABLE appointments (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    patient_phone TEXT,
    doctor_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    specialty TEXT NOT NULL,
    appointment_date TEXT NOT NULL,
    appointment_time TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'confirmed',
    symptoms TEXT,
    urgency_level TEXT DEFAULT 'normal'
);

-- 10 Doctors across 8 specialties
-- Real-time availability checking
-- Appointment conflict prevention
```

---

## 🎯 Conversation Flow Design

### **State Management**
```python
class ConversationState(Enum):
    IDLE = "idle"
    COLLECTING_SPECIALTY = "collecting_specialty"
    COLLECTING_DOCTOR = "collecting_doctor"
    COLLECTING_PATIENT_INFO = "collecting_patient_info"
    COLLECTING_DATE_TIME = "collecting_date_time"
    CONFIRMING_APPOINTMENT = "confirming_appointment"
    HANDLING_EMERGENCY = "handling_emergency"
```
